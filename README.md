# Multithreaded OS Kernel 
This is a learning project to study the core of a multithreaded operating system! This project is designed to gain practical experience and a deep understanding of the development of a multithreaded operating system (OS) kernel. At the moment, I am only studying the structure of the core and development is moving very slowly.    
### This project will contain:
- kernel with FAT16 file system
- the ability to swap memory
- availability of virtual memory
- own virtual file system layer
